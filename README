README

AppleEventBridge is a mostly cleaned-up, modernized fork of objc-appscript
(http://appscript.sourceforge.net). Some work remains to be done; for now,
it is released as-is.

AppleEventBridge currently depends on a number of legacy/deprecated Carbon
APIs (see LEGACY API WRAPPERS) and is therefore unsupported and not
recommended for production use. (This may change should Apple add fully-
supported Cocoa API equivalents to future OS X releases.) No warranty given,
E&OE, use at own risk, etc.

AppleEventBridge is released into the public domain.

README

AppleEventBridge provides client-side Apple event bindings for Swift and
Objective-C, enabling them to control "AppleScriptable" OS X applications
directly. For example:

  tell application id "com.apple.TextEdit" to get text of document 1

  let result = try TextEdit().documents[1].text.get() as! String

  id result = [[TEDApplication application].documents[1].text getItem];

AppleEventBridge is a modernized, reworked fork of the objc-appscript bridge
(http://appscript.sourceforge.net). Its objective is to provide Apple's Swift
language with first-class application scripting support, equal in capability
and compatibility to AppleScript's own.

Its high-level API is mostly stable, though future updates may enhance/change
it to improve language integration (e.g. better type support). Internal APIs
and implementation may change radically in future; this release is provided
primarily for exploration, experimentation, and feedback purposes rather than
production use.

Swift and Objective-C documentation is provided, though still rough in places.
Code examples and a simple SwiftAETranslate app for translating AppleScript
commands to the equivalent Swift syntax are also included.

AppleEventBridge is released into the public domain.

README

AppleEventBridge is a mostly cleaned-up, modernized fork of objc-appscript
(http://appscript.sourceforge.net). Some work remains to be done; for now,
it is released as-is.

When compiled for 10.10 and earlier, AppleEventBridge uses a number of
legacy/deprecated Carbon APIs (see LEGACY API WRAPPERS). Builds that
target 10.11+ use fully supported OS X APIs only.

No warranty given, E&OE, use at own risk, etc.

AppleEventBridge is released into the public domain.
